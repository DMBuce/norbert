norbert(1)
==========

Name
----
norbert - command-line NBT editor

Synopsis
--------
'norbert' [options] [tag[=value]] [tag2[=value2]] ...

Description
-----------
Norbert edits or displays an NBT file. With no arguments, it opens 'level.dat'
in the working directory and prints its contents to stdout in a human-readable
format.

'tag' is the name of a tag. Its format is described in the *Names*
section of linkman:norbert[5]. If 'value' is given, it is used to set the
payload of 'tag'. Valid 'values' are described in the *Values* section of
linkman:norbert[5].

Norbert is written in Python using Thomas Woolford's
https://github.com/twoolie/NBT[NBT library].

Options
-------

*--version*::
	Display version number and exit.

*-h, --help*::
	Display syntax and exit.

*-f, --input-file* <file>::
	The file to read. Default is +level.dat+.
+
Reading from stdin is currently not supported.

*-o, --output-file* <file>::
	The file to write to. If not provided, any changes made with +'tag'='value'+
	arguments won't be written to disk.
+
WARNING: This option will overwrite the data in 'file'. If 'file' is being
used by minecraft, or if norbert encounters an error, 'file' can become
corrupt. Use this option with caution and make backups if necessary.

*-p, --print-format* <format>::
	Format to print output in. Valid values are +human+, +nbt-txt+ and
	+norbert+, and are described below.
+
* *human*: An indented, human-readable format. This is the default.
* *nbt-txt*: A text format similar to the one used in the original NBT spec.
* *norbert*: A text format designed to be easily parsed by command-line tools.
See linkman:norbert[5] for details.

*-i, --input-format* <format>::
	Format of the input file. Valid values are +nbt+ and +norbert+, and are
	described below.
+
* *nbt*: The NBT format. This is the default.
* *norbert*: A text format designed to be easily parsed by command-line tools.
See linkman:norbert[5] for details.

*-d, --depth* <depth>::
	Set the maximum recursion depth when printing. Use 0 for no
	limit. Default is 8.

*-s, --separator* <separator>::
	Set the tag separators for norbert-formatted input, and output, and
	+'tag'='value'+ arguments.
	The argument to this option must be a string of one or two characters. The
	first character is used to delimit tag names, and the second character is
	used to delimit list indices. Default is +,#+.

Examples
--------

norbert --help::
	Get usage info.

norbert::
	View +level.dat+.

norbert -f /path/to/level.dat::
	Same, but use +level.dat+ from another directory.

norbert -f player.dat::
	View +player.dat+.

norbert Data,GameType::
	View +GameType+ tag in +level.dat+.

norbert -o level.dat Data,GameType=1::
	Set game mode to Creative. Warning: Back up +level.dat+ first!

norbert -d 0 -f player.dat -p norbert >player.dat.norbert::
	Save +player.dat+ in linkman:norbert[5] format.

norbert -d 0 -f player.dat.norbert -i norbert -o player.dat::
	Convert +player.dat.norbert+ from norbert to NBT and save it as
	+player.dat+.

Limitations
-----------

When parsing a norbert-formatted file, tags have the following limitations.

* Tags can not have an equals sign (+=+) in their 'name'
* Tags can not have either of the separators (+,+ and +#+ by default) in their 'name'
* The 'name' of the root tag can not start with whitespace
* The 'name' of the leaf tag can not end with whitespace
* The 'value' of TAG_Strings can not start or end with whitespace

Any attempt to parse tags in norbert files with these properties will yield
unexpected results. For more info on the norbert file format, see
linkman:norbert[5].

Bugs
----

Known bugs. Fixes coming Soon(TM):

* Doesn't support non-gzipped NBT files
* Doesn't support Region files
* Doesn't always play nice with stdin/stdout

Report any and all bugs to the norbert
https://github.com/DMBuce/norbert/issues[issue tracker] with as much detail as
possible.
